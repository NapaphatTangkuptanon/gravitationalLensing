This is Computational Physic project which is not done yet.

1.Solve equation 3 on the grid: use 5-point stencil with Gaussâ€“Seidel / SOR iteration. Apply Dirichlet boundary condition  = 0 at the edges. (L=6 , N= 512, pixel size =L/N, number of iteration is in optimization progress)
2.Compute deflection and shear: deflection from equation 2, shear from second derivative.
3.Ray Tracing to form image: map each image plane from the source plane equation.
4.Instrument model: Applied Gaussian PSF convolution (FFT), Added Poisson and Gaussian read noise to generate noisy image.

This is what have been done by this respiratory

Suggestion:

1.Dont run GuassSeidal.py since it's took very long time to run
2.Done task 5-7
"
1.Stimulate and visualize: extremely long execution time
2.Measurement: estimate Einstein-ring radius, compute total magnification.
3.Parameter study: adjust and visualize how the changes in parameters affect the image.
